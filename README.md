JTTimeView is a simple view that can be used programatically or via a storyboard to select time via two sliders. The hours slider turns into a moon or sun icon depending on the time. The code is quite hardcoded to iPhone and my specific purpose at the moment, will make it more themeable if there is uptake :)
